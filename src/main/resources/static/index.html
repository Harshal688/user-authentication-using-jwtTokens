        I am 21 years old and still am unemployed, i really
        want to make a lot of money and buy the things i want 
        today is 2nd december 2024 and i still don't know
        how will my future turn out , i am getting 
        older but with no money i am still heavily relying 
        on my mother , just after a month it's new year it's 
        2025 in blink of an eye , i just want to live a good life. 
        i hope 2025 has great things store in for me.
